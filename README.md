#Decentralized Academic Certificate Issuance & Verification System#
📌 Overview

This project implements a Decentralized Academic Certificate Issuance and Verification System using Blockchain technology, with Python as the primary programming language.
The system ensures secure, tamper-proof, and transparent handling of academic certificates by storing certificate data on the blockchain.

🔗 Why Blockchain?

Prevents certificate forgery

Ensures data immutability

Provides transparent verification

Eliminates dependence on centralized authorities

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Core application logic)

Blockchain (Decentralized ledger)

Web3.py (Blockchain interaction)

Solidity (Smart contract)

Ganache / Ethereum Test Network

⚙️ How the System Works

Academic institutions generate certificates

Certificate data is hashed using Python

Hash is stored on the blockchain

Verification is done by matching hashes

Blockchain ensures authenticity and integrity
🔐 Security Features

Cryptographic hashing

Immutable blockchain storage

Decentralized verification

Python-based validation

📈 Future Scope

Support for multiple institutions

Improved automation using Python

Integration with public Ethereum networks

QR-based certificate verification
